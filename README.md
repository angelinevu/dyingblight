In summary, I have created a work-in-progress game to simulate a zombie apocalypse where the player must survive
for as long as possible. 

HP: Hit Points
FP: Food Points

Future Updates:
A leaderboard for scores
Cleaner UI
New mobs, combinations of mobs
A key input instead of sleep() for spawn events

FIX/CLEAN: 
Inventory is full but prompts otherwise
Spawn probabilities
